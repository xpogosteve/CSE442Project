We have 2 dispute systems. A game of pool if possible, but otherwise a game of paper football if issue is time sensitive.


What we plan to do is create a VR billiards game with motion control support. The core project is a 3d interacable space for at least
2 players on seprate devices playing against eachother. While billiards is our focus, we would like to possibly incorperate a matchmaking hub 
and possibly other games as well. We plan to develop for the oculus rift and possibly for the HTC vive for a roomscale vr expierence.
